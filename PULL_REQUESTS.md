# Pull Requests

Pull requests are a key feature for collaboration, allowing developers to propose changes to a repository and request reviews from their peers.
They provide a structured way to discuss and incorporate modifications, fostering teamwork and code quality.
Pull requests facilitate transparency and accountability in the development process, ensuring that changes are thoroughly reviewed before being merged into the main codebase.

## Creating a Pull Request on Github (PR)

To create a PR you need a remote branch you want to merge into the main branch.
After finishing your feature (or whatever purpose your branch had) you can create a PR on Github by navigating the your branch, and clicking on "New Pull Request".
You can provide a title and description, then click on "Create Pull Request".
