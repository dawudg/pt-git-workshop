# Actions

GitHub Actions automates workflows in your GitHub repository, allowing you to build, test, and deploy your code seamlessly.
With Actions, you can set up custom workflows triggered by various events, such as push, pull request, or schedule.
These workflows can run tasks like running tests, building Docker images, or deploying to production environments.
GitHub Actions provides a flexible and powerful way to automate your development processes, saving time and improving efficiency for your team.
