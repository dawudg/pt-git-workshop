# Git Collaboration

Git collaboration allows multiple team members to work on a project together smoothly. By using branches, each person can tackle different tasks without interfering with each other. Pull requests make it easy to review and incorporate changes, ensuring everyone stays on the same page.

## Git Centralized Workflow

The Git centralized workflow is straightforward and effective for teams collaborating on a project.
In this approach, there's typically a central repository where all team members push their changes (usually remote repository on Github or GitLab etc...).
Developers clone this central repository to their local machines, make changes, and then push those changes back to the central repository.
It's a simple method that works well for smaller teams or projects where there's a single authoritative source of truth.
